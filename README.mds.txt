# Solar System Planet Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores key characteristics of solar system planets, including distance from the Sun, size, gravity, and orbital period. The analysis applies data analysis and visualisation techniques to a scientific dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
- Data loading and validation
- Feature engineering (planet classification)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Scientific data visualisation
- Insight generation

## Key Findings
- Distance from the Sun strongly correlates with orbital period.
- Gas and ice giants differ significantly from terrestrial planets in size and gravity.
- Simple data grouping improves interpretability of scientific data.

## Next Steps
- Add moons or exoplanet data
- Apply logarithmic scaling
- Explore predictive relationships
